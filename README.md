# My Personal Project Website

Welcome to my personal project website! This is a fun, facetious project where I've created a simple webpage styled to look like a doodled notepad. The idea was to create something whimsical and enjoyable.

View the website: www.AndrewGeorgiou.co.uk

## About the Project

This website is purely for fun and personal enjoyment. It uses:

- **HTML**: for the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: to create the doodled notepad look and feel.
- **JavaScript**: for any interactive elements.
- **Hosting**: The site is hosted on my personal VPS.

## Features

- **SVG Animation**: This website uses only animated SVG's, the stylised handwriting was done by myself on my iPad Pro using Procreate which I then vectorised and created a mask to follow the filled SVG.
- **LocalStorage Dark-Mode**: Retains preferred mode (dark-mode / light-mode) using local storage.
